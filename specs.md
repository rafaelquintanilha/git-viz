This app should be a simple HTML, JavaScript, and CSS app to be able to visualize Git. So the idea here is to make sure that somebody who is starting to code understands what Git is, to understand what is a master, what is a branch, what is a merge, what is a commit. So I want to visualize this in this repo so I can showcase this app with a visual, let's say, animation where we can represent a branch, master, pull request, and so on and so forth. So the idea here is maybe like a single HTML page with some interactivity so people can actually understand. It would be nice also for us to have the commands explained. This app will be in Portuguese for Brazilian speakers. So it's important that the text is in Brazilian Portuguese even though the whole code should be in English, right? So the code is in English but the text, the text, the copy, the text that people are seeing should be in Brazilian Portuguese.
